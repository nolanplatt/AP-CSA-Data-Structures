# Tech Talk Notes

## **Tech Talk 1**


## **Tech Talk 0 | Data Structures**

* Data Structure → a "method of organizing data". They hold a single integer value (maybe like n=3) or they can hold multiple items (arrays, arraylists, stacks, queues, etc). 
* Data Strucs + Algorithms → interact simultaneously in the CS paradigm. 
* Array→ fixed length
* ArrayList→ no fixed length (variable/changes)
* HashMap→ index and value
* Algorithms *always* acompany data structures (e.g. the Fibonacci sequence - we must use both algorithms and data structures)

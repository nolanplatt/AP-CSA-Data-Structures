## 4/19: 2015 Practice Exam MCQ
![Score Tangible](https://i.imgur.com/6LVG91C.png)
Score: 33/39
Corrections:

Q9:\
Selected A, although it is E because I forgot to consider two different cubes. The option I selected is correct for one cube. I simply need to spend more time evaluating the validity of my option.\
Q22:\
Selected E, correct option is A. Instead of using traditional for loop, we need to use two enhanced for loops. Otherwise, we will be printing column row instead of row column.\
Q33:\
Selected D, although the correct option is E. Code segment 1 works because Integer.MIN_VALUE is a valid Java method, although I did not know this when I took the exam.\
Q34:\
Selected E, although the correct option is D. The option that I selected, E, does not work because we need to consider listOfWords.size(), not result.length(), which would be evaluating the incorrect object.\
Q35:\
I incorrectly selected option B, however the right answer is option C. When I incorrectly selected "3", I failed to consider the midpoint that is calculated, hence I did not realize the returned value is actually option C: "5".\
Q37:\
I incorrectly selected option E, however the actual answer is option D. Code segment 3 will not work as intended because it fails to consider all values - even with two for loops, it loops through the wrong values.\

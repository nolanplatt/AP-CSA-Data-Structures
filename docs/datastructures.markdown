* Key Learnings In Week 1:
During this week's challenges, I learned much more about Queues/LinkedLists, Stacks, and how they fit into the OOP paradgim. Before this week, I never really considered or thought about how data structures are literally crucial to the usage of algorithms. During this challenge, I used several algorithms with my data structures. This can be seen in some of my code snippets above. I believe one of my biggest takeaways from this challenge is the usage of a Stack to reverse a Queue. I've known how queues work (push and pop), but never really thought how those could be used with Queues for the purpose of reversing one - or even normalizing a Queue if it's already reversed. It opened my eyes on how, when we're working with data structures, we need to look at it intuitively rather than objectively; if we look at it objectively, we will fail to see other data structures (like Stacks) that we can use to easily meet our task.

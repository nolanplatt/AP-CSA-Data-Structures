# Test Prep (TPT) Plan

# Test Plan:

1. Monday: I will review each Unit's main points and ideas. I will take brief notes on each unit to prepare myself for an MCQ practice on Tuesday.
2. Tuesday: I will do a practice MCQ for the entire course (30 MCQ). I will note which questions I either got wrong, struggled with, or even guessed and got right. If I am confused by any of the questions I will note them down to ask on Wednesday.
3. Wednesday: I will do a practice FRQ from a previous year. No outside help or electronics. I will set timer for College Board's time. At the end, I will score my FRQs, correct them, and then understand what I got wrong.
4. Thursday: I will do MCQs for each unit in AP classroom. Each unit has a practice MCQ (~10 questions wrong), will do one for each unit and review what I got wrong.
5. Friday: At the end of the week, I will add to my journal big ideas that I learned throughout the week, along with my compiled/graded scores and corrections.
 
## Studying
Each week of this trimester before the AP exam, I will be reviewing some College Board topic.\
To illustrate, College Board has many topic videos, practice questions/FRQs, MCQs, etc. I will be practicing at least one of these every week.\
For a traditional week, this will consist of:\
 → Reviewing certain topic/unit by watching videos, reading articles, etc.\
 → MCQ or FRQ question(s)\
 → Review answer key(s): correct what I got wrong, if any, and learn from mistakes.
## Being Organized
I will be accountable for myself and will not fall off course. I understand importance of the AP exam, and thus I will keep a calendar w/ tangibles and plans for every week. For each week, this will consist of:\
→ On Sunday before week start, creating plan for rest of week till Sun.\
→ For each day, I will detail how I will be studying that part (following the topic above in "Studying" bullet point)\
→ Laying out estimated times to keep myself consistent and notg understudy or even overstudy\
→ This will give me ample time to be thoroughly prepared for the AP exam.
## Hands-on Learning
→ I learn best by *doing* - thus, as stated in the "Studying" bullet point, I will not only be accountable for myself, but I will be consistently practicing.\
 → This means grinding out FRQs, MCQs, challenges, etc → actively participating in class discussions, stand ups, etc.\
→ In my view, "hands on learning" is the best way to thoroughly prepare for the AP Computer Science A exam. This way, when I go into the exam, I will already know what it feels like and instantaneously be able to attack and succeed at any challenge College Board throws at me.

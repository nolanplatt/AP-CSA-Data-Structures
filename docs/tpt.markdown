# Test Prep (TPT) Plan

## Studying
Each week of this trimester before the AP exam, I will be reviewing some College Board topic.\
To illustrate, College Board has many topic videos, practice questions/FRQs, MCQs, etc. I will be practicing at least one of these every week.\
For a traditional week, this will consist of:\
 → Reviewing certain topic/unit by watching videos, reading articles, etc.\
 → MCQ or FRQ question(s)\
 → Review answer key(s): correct what I got wrong, if any, and learn from mistakes.\
## Being Organized
I will be accountable for myself and will not fall off course. I understand importance of the AP exam, and thus I will keep a calendar w/ tangibles and plans for every week. For each week, this will consist of:\
→ On Sunday before week start, creating plan for rest of week till Sun.\
→ For each day, I will detail how I will be studying that part (following the topic above in "Studying" bullet point)\
→ Laying out estimated times to keep myself consistent and notg understudy or even overstudy\
→ This will give me ample time to be thoroughly prepared for the AP exam.\
## Hands-on Learning
→ I learn best by *doing* - thus, as stated in the "Studying" bullet point, I will not only be accountable for myself, but I will be consistently practicing.\
 → This means grinding out FRQs, MCQs, challenges, etc → actively participating in class discussions, stand ups, etc.\
→ In my view, "hands on learning" is the best way to thoroughly prepare for the AP Computer Science A exam. This way, when I go into the exam, I will already know what it feels like and instantaneously be able to attack and succeed at any challenge College Board throws at me.\
